# Remarks:
- Updating CloudFront is SLOW. Don't panic.

# TODOS:
- TLS
- Restrict persianpapa.com.s3.amazonaws.com to CloudFront only
- Upload site/ to s3 in script (along with gzip, etc)
- It might be a mistake to go CloudFront -> Bucket, see https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/5kmv04/how_long_does_cloudfront_take_to_take_effect/
